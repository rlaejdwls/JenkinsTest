##Test instance lifecycle
# Sometimes you need to execute a method before or after all tests of a given class.
#Like Junit 4, JUnit 5 requires by default these methods to be static (which translates to companion object in Kotlin,
#which is quite verbose and not straightforward) because test classes are instantiated one time per test.
# But Junit 5 allows you to change this default behavior and instantiate test classes one time per class.
#This can be done in various ways, here we will use a property file to change the default
junit.jupiter.testinstance.lifecycle.default = per_class
